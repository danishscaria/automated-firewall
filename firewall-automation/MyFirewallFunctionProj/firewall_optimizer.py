firewall_optimizer.py

This module uses the Z3 SMT solver to formulate and solve a MaxSMT problem for automated firewall configuration.
It models:
  - A simplified network topology with predefined Allocation Places (APs)
  - Network Security Requirements (NSRs) as logical constraints
  - An objective to minimize the number of deployed firewall instances

Usage:
  Call the optimize_firewalls() function to run the optimizer and obtain a solution.
