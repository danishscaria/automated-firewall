update_firewall.py

This module integrates the firewall optimization model (using Z3) with a firewall configuration API.
It retrieves the optimized firewall allocation, builds a set of configuration rules, and then updates
the firewall settings automatically via an HTTP API call.

Usage:
    Run this script to update the firewall configuration based on the current optimization model.
